## Description

CardioRVAR Shiny is a shiny app developed by Alvaro Chao-Ecija (intern student at the 
Department of Physiology and the Autonomic Nervous System Unit at CIMES, University of
Malaga) and PhD. Marc Stefan Dawid-Milner (head of the unit and supervisor of the project). 
This app is designed to work with the CardioRVAR main package (see https://github.com/CIMES-USNA-UMA/CardioRVAR),
allowing a better experience without having to use the commands in R or Rstudio.
